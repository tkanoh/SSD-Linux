### Parallel port IP ###
#plip


### non-IDE CD-ROM drive ###
# These modules add CD-ROM drive support.  Most of these drivers will probe
# for the I/O address and IRQ of the drive automatically if the parameters
# to configure them are omitted. Typically the I/O address will be specified 
# in hexadecimal, e.g.: cm206=0x300,11
#
# ***NONE*** of these drivers are for use with IDE/ATAPI CD-ROM drives.  That
# support is already built into every pre-compiled Slackware Linux kernel.
# Also, note that all of the manufacturers listed below stopped making these
# types of wacky-interface drives years ago and all make IDE/ATAPI-interface
# CD-ROM drives now.  So, just because your drive says "Mitsumi" on it is not 
# reason enough to think you need the special Mitsumi module loaded, etc.  If
# you got your drive within the last couple of years it's probably IDE.  Try 
# tossing a disc in the drive and mounting it on the various IDE interfaces it
# could be using, like /dev/hdc.

# with the Linux 2.2.x source code.  This file can also be found on the
# Slackware CD-ROM in the /docs/linux-2.2.x/ directory.
#
# First, if setup probing found a network card, there may be an 'rc.netdevice'
# file that we should run to load the network module:
#if [ -x /etc/rc.d/rc.netdevice ]; then
#  . /etc/rc.d/rc.netdevice

#ftape 			# Floppy tape support (such as Colorado Jumbo 250 or other QIC-80 drives)


### IP masquerading modules:
# These modules are used with IP masquerading, a process which allows you to
# use a Linux box connected to the Internet (via PPP or SLIP, or some other
# means) as a gateway for other Linux, Windows, Macintosh boxes on your local
# network that don't have real IP addresses on the Internet.  The packets
# going through the Linux machine are "masqueraded", or made to look as if
# they're all coming from the one real IP address on the Internet.
#
# As a quick example (for a much more extensive treatment, see the IP-Masquerade
# mini-HOWTO) to allow Internet access to a local network 192.168.11.0 with a
# netmask of 255.255.255.0, you'd use these commands in /etc/rc.d/rc.local:
#
#  echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
#  echo "Setting up NAT (Network Address Translation)..."
#  # by default, nothing is forwarded.
#  ipchains -P forward REJECT"
#  # anything going from inside network to outside is masqueraded
#  ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.11.0/24 -d \! 192.168.11.0/24 -j MASQ"
#  # anything going from one internal machine to another can pass unmolested
#  ipchains -A forward -s 192.168.11.0/24 -d 192.168.11.0/24 -j ACCEPT"
#
# Then you'd have to set the other boxes on your local network to use the
# Linux machine as their TCP/IP gateway.  You'll probably also need to plug
# in the IP address for your Internet service provider in each machine's DNS
# setup.

#ipchains		# To use ipchains with newer kernels, you'll need this.

# Now, on to the IP masquerading modules.  The example above is good enough
# for most things that use TCP in a relatively simple fashion.  It'll work
# for telnet and http, for instance.  But, the system breaks down when you
# get protocols that use ports in more complicated ways.  Luckily the Linux
# kernel gurus have thought of this and have prepared some modules that
# support masquerading of trickier protocols.  The ipchains command is mighty
# flexible as well, and a lot of things can be made to work just by setting
# that up correctly.
#
## These modules are in linux-2.2.x.  Newer versions may use different modules.
## See also "man iptables" for information about a newer tool for Linux 2.4+.
