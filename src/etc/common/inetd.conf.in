# If you make changes to this file, either reboot your machine or send the
# inetd a HUP signal:
# Do a "ps x" as root and look up the pid of inetd. Then do a
# "kill -HUP <pid of inetd>".
# The inetd will re-read this file whenever it gets that signal.

# This is for BSD sendmail.  NOTE:  It's not a good idea to uncomment this
# one, since sendmail is already set up to run as a daemon in /etc/rc.d/rc.M.
# But, if you really want to run sendmail this way for some reason, you'll 
# need to uncomment the smtp line below AND change the line in /etc/rc.d/rc.M
# to run sendmail like this:  /usr/sbin/sendmail -q30m   
# ...otherwise the queue will not be processed.
