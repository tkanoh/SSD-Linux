.Dt PORTMAP 8
.Os BSD 4.3
.Sh NAME
.Nm portmap
.Nd
.Tn DARPA
port to
.Tn RPC
program number mapper
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm portmap
.Op Fl dv
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm Portmap
is a server that converts
.Tn RPC
program numbers into
.Tn DARPA
protocol port numbers.
It must be running in order to make
.Tn RPC
calls.
.Pp
When an
.Tn RPC
server is started, it will tell
.Nm portmap
what port number it is listening to, and what
.Tn RPC
program numbers it is prepared to serve.
When a client wishes to make an
.Tn RPC
call to a given program number,
it will first contact
.Nm portmap
on the server machine to determine
the port number where
.Tn RPC
packets should be sent.
.Pp
.Nm Portmap
must be started before any
.Tn RPC
servers are invoked.
.Pp
Normally
.Nm portmap
forks and dissociates itself from the terminal
like any other daemon.
.Nm Portmap
then logs errors using
.Xr syslog 3 .
.Pp
Option available:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
(debug) prevents
.Nm portmap
from running as a daemon,
and causes errors and debugging information
to be printed to the standard error output.
.It Fl v
(verbose) causes
.Nm portmap
to give more logging information to
.Xr syslogd 8.
.Pp
.Sh Access control
By default, host access control is enabled. However, the host that runs
the portmapper is always considered authorized. The host access control
tables are never consulted with requests from the local system itself;
they are always consulted with requests from other hosts.
.Pp
In order to avoid deadlocks, the portmap program does not attempt to
look up the remote host name or user name, nor will it try to match NIS
netgroups. The upshot of all this is that only network number patterns
will work for portmap access control.
.Pp
Sample entries for the host access-control files are:

.Nm    /etc/hosts.allow:
        portmap: your.sub.net.number/your.sub.net.mask
        portmap: 255.255.255.255 0.0.0.0

.Nm    /etc/hosts.deny
        portmap: ALL

The syntax of the access-control files is described in the
.Xr hosts_access 5
and
.Xr hosts_options 5
manual page that comes with the tcp wrapper (log_tcp)
sources.  The safe_finger command comes with later wrapper releases.
.Pp
The first line in the hosts.allow file permits access from all systems
within your own subnet. Some rpc services rely on broadcasts and will
contact your portmapper anyway; and once an intruder has access to your
local network segment you're already in deep trouble.
.Pp
The second line in the hosts.allow file may be needed if there are
any PC-NFS systems on your network segment.
.Pp
For security reasons, the portmap process drops root privilegs after
initialization. The access control files should therefore be readable
for group or world.

.Sh BUGS
If
.Nm portmap
crashes, all servers must be restarted.
