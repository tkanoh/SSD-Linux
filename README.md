# SSD-Linux

This repository is SSD/Linux as of March 2005, when I was maintaining it.

The base concept of SSD/Linux was "KISS = Keep it simple, stupid."

However, those who succeeded the maintainers did not understand this at all and destroyed it.

It is of no use to me now, but still frustrating, so I repost it here.
